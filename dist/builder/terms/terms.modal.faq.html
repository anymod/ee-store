  <h4>Is eeosk really free to use?</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Yes, eeosk is a free service for building your own store with products from the eeosk catalog.  It’s not a “freemium” service... it’s completely free! As in, “you don’t even need a credit card to use it” free. You may choose to spend money to advertise your store on places like Google and Facebook, but that is completely optional.</p>
